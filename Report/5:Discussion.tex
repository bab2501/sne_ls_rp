%% here should we talk about the result %%%









%% Alexander: Short note to not forget %%


\subsubsection{discus result}
%[23:47, 28-12-2017] +31 6 : This is the picture from the presentation..... the yellow one in the right down corner
%%- Hardware: ~ 10 ms
%%- VM (2cpu/1g): ~ 30 ms
%%- VM (8cpu/4gb): ~ 15 ms
%%[23:52, 28-12-2017] +31 6 : Result is: 5.000 > 20.000 ms ( + 1,5 second )  if migration full setup to virutal
%%Result is:  10ms > 15 ms ( + 5ms )   ... for a static website
%%[2chkar: So we fixed the problem
%%[r: (((( you fixed the problem ))))
%% Conclusion:   5 ms delay of virtualisation ( 33 % ) ... if you move the full setup... then %%it becomes 1,5 second slower
%% : I think it is because the setup is not made for virualisation on ONE hypervisor
%%: In the first situation you have 4 servers ( 16cpu / 16 gb ) * 4
%%: In the virual you have 1 server ( 16 cpu / 16gb ) * 1
%% However you have a lot of overhead it costs 1,5 second .
