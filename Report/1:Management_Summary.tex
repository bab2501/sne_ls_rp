\section*{Abstract}
\paragraph{}
This project has been conducted to evaluate performance loss of virtualization on virtual servers compared to physical server. In this project we will focus on medium size e-commerce websites. Our main target for performance testing is the website response time.   

\paragraph{}
During the duration of the project a number of experiments were conducted. Started from a complex environment with a distributed web application and later brought back to a simple static web page. These experiments were simulated a real life users experience scenerio. 
\paragraph{}
We aFor the proof of concept a scenario of a webshop was performed on the website. Four physical servers are used to setup the physical situation. The 5th server has been used as Xenserver with 4 VM's with the same setup. 
\paragraph{}
The loss or performance depends on the application architecture. It differs 5 milliseconds with a simple application up to 2 seconds for a complex application.
\paragraph{}
As future work for our project we propose to using higher variance of web application and server operating system.
