\section*{Abstract}
\paragraph{}
This project has been conducted to evaluate performance loss of virtualization on virtual servers compared to physical server. In this project we will focus on medium size e-commerce websites. Our main target for performance testing is the website response time. \par
During the duration of the project a number of experiments were conducted. Started from a complex environment with a distributed web application and later brought back to a simple static web page. These experiments simulated a real life users experience scenario.
\par
After going going through the project we found that the loss of performance depends on the application architecture. It differs 5 milliseconds with a simple application up to 2 seconds for a complex application.
