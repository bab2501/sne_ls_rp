\section{Conclusion}
%Small paragraph (or two) summarizing the report.%

%% NO NEW INFORMATION !!!! this shoud be before eg. discussion 
%% Here we need to answer the questions only. (nothing more, summery is in abstract)


        1) Will be there any performance loss of virtualization?\\
        %% Answer is sub conclusion %%

        2) Which is more suitable for a mid-size business infrastructure?\\
        %% Answer is sub conclusion %%

        Final question:\\
        3) How do virtual servers compared to physical servers differ in term of performance?\\
        %%% >>>  Answer to this question is the main Conclusion <<<

%% The small paragraph should contain above... in a story form ... we did x then y and found the answer z.

\subsection{Future Work}
As future work for our project we might enrich and improve the contents and the output of this research by applying few ideas, such as using other applications such as \textbf{Vmware} or \textbf{Virtual Box} or any other proprietary software solutions for virtulization.  In addition to experiment the setup on different operating system such as \textbf{Windows}. We might also use more variance of hardware to build the setup environment. Another important idea is to make more intense and larger test setup with longer measurement time. These ideas help with furthering the findings on these password managers and could open the doors to new findings.
