\section{Conclusion}
\paragraph{}
There is a performance loss of virtualization based. The total loss of performance is highly influenced on the setup and architecture of the applications which are running. When an application is not optimized for virtualization the performance may drop significant. In a more simple static website setup we notice performance difference of 5ms.
\par
We consider that 5 milisecond the pure loss of virtualization.

\subsection{Future Work}
As future work for our project we might enrich and improve the contents and the output of this research by applying few ideas, such as using othe applications such as \textbf{Vmware} or \textbf{Virtual Box} or any other proprietary software solutions for virtulization.  In addition to experiment the setup on different operating system such as \textbf{Windows}. We might also use more variance of hardware to build the setup environment. Another important idea is to make more intense and larger test setup with longer measurement time. These ideas help with furthering the findings on these password managers and could open the doors to new findings.
