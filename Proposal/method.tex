\section{Approach and Methods}
\paragraph{}
The project aims to test(susceptible to change):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lastpass
    \item Dashlane
    \item Keepass
    \item Passbolt
\end{itemize}

Our idea is to start by testing the communication of the online password managers to the server and back. This will be done using tools such as the burp suite to grab the communication with the server for closer inspection. We then intend to see if some older vulnerabilities are still present in newer versions of the plug-ins and native software. Futhermore, we can possibly try fuzzing software to test at least the offline solutions. Lastly we are going to review the code of the open source solutions for any coding malpractices that could decrease the security of the solutions.
